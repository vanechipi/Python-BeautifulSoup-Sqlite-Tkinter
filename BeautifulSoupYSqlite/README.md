####**P4Evaluable.py:**
It has an interface to automate searching for information and not have to browser one or many websites. The idea is to have our program loaded in the URLs of websites that interest us and by the input parameters make relevant search.

With Tkinter we built three buttons with the following functions:

* "Store Categories", that using BeautifulSoup, be able to extract all the names and links to the various elements categorized, and stored in a sqlite database.

* "Search Category" which displays a window that allows the user to enter a category and displayed in another window (in a listbox with scrollbar) elements and links on it, extracting them from the DB.

* "Event Search", which shows a window that allows the user to enter a
word and displayed in another window with news of events containing such word.
