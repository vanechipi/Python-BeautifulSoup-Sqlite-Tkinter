####**Ejercicio2.py:**

####**Ejercicio3.py:**
Write a function that receives an unordered list and an element that:

* Locate all the items matching the passed parameter and returns the number of matches found.

* Find the first occurrence of the element in the list and return its position.

* Using the above function, search all items matching the passed parameter and returns a list of positions.

####**Ejercicio4.py:**
Write a function that takes a list of tuples, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the first elements of the tuples, and the values â€‹ are listed with the second elements.
For example:
l = [('Hola', 'Don Pepito'), ('Hola', 'Don Jose'), ('Good', 'day')]
print tuplas_a_diccionario(l)
It should show: {'Hola': ['Don Pepito', 'Don Jose'], 'Good': ['day']}
